    "Mathematical **expressions** are the basic building block of **Prove-It** <a href=\"#proofs\">proofs</a>.  These are represented with rendered LaTeX.  As much as possible, this representation should reflect the internal contents of the **expression** object.  However, to fully understand what is actually being represented by an **expression**, click on the rendered LaTeX to view its <a href=\"#expr_info\">expression information</a> web page.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Expressions** form <a href=\"#judgment\">judgments</a> that are used in the derivation steps of a **proof**.  An **expression** has no intrinsic value type, unlike in conventional theorem-proving approaches.  It does have a *type* that refers to the kind of operation or mathematical object.  There are 9 *core types* recognized for having specific rules in proof <a href=\"#proof_deriv\">derivations</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <a name=\"variable\"></a>`Variable`: A label that is interchangeable (as long as it is kept distinct from other labels) with no intrinsic meaning.  It is usually represented by a single letter but can have any representation.\n",
    "* <a name=\"literal\"></a>`Literal`: A label that is not interchangeable and has an intrinsic meaning.  Specific operators ($\\lnot, \\land, +, \\times$, etc.) and specific irreducibe values ($\\top, \\bot, 0, 5$, etc.) are all `Literal`s.  Furthermore, a problem-story `Variable` in a particular **theory**, representing some unknown but particular value, should also be a `Literal` (e.g., \"Ann has $a$ apples...\").\n",
    "* <a name=\"operation\"></a>`Operation`: The application of *operator(s)* on *operand(s)*.  For example, $0 + 5 + 8$ and $1 < a \\leq b < 3$ are examples of *operation* expressions.  The **Prove-It** library defines many *types* derived from the *operation* type (e.g., for each specific operation), but the <a href=\"#proof_deriv\">derivation rules</a> only need to know that these are *operations*.\n",
    "* <a name=\"lambda\"></a>`Lambda`: A mapping defined by *parameter* `Variable`s transforming to some *body* `Expression` but only when the *parameter(s)* meet certain *condition(s)*.  For example, $(x, y, z) \\mapsto x+y/z~|~x \\in \\mathbb{R}, y \\in \\mathbb{R}, z \\in \\mathbb{R}, z \\neq 0$ is a conditional **lambda** that converts three real numbers $x, y, z$ to $x + y/z$ as long as $z$ is not zero.  Note that a `Lambda` introduces `Variables` into a new scope via the *parameters*.  These *parameter* `Variable`s are said to be *bound* in this new scope; occurrences outside this scope are not deemed to be the same thing. There is a special category of `Operation` types called `OperationOverInstances` that are essentially functionals acting on a `Lambda` operand.  $\\forall$, $\\exists$, $\\sum$, and $\\prod$ are examples of `OperationOverInstances`.  For example, $\\forall_{x~|~Q(x)} P(x)$ is an expression that translates to \"$P(x)$ is true for all values of $x$ for which $Q(x)$ is also true\".  Internally, this is represented as an $\\forall$ operator acting on the conditional `Lambda` map $x \\mapsto P(x)~|~Q(x)$.\n",
    "* <a name=\"expr_tuple\"></a>`ExprTuple`: A list of `Expression`s that is used, for example, when there are multiple *operators* or *operands* of an `Operation` or multiple *parameters* of a `Lambda`.\n",
    "* <a name=\"expr_array\"></a>`ExprArray`: A multi-dimensional (e.g., two-dimensional) array of `Expression`s. This can be used, for example, to represent a quantum circuit which is a two-dimensional graphical representation of a sequence of quantum operations.  A 2-D representation of a matrix is a more basic example.  More work is required to properly implement and test the *ExprArray* class.\n",
    "* *NamedExprs*: A mapping from keyword strings to `Expression`s.  This can be used to prevent ambiguity of an expression's internal representation.\n",
    "* <a name=\"indexed\"></a>`Indexed`: A particular indexed element of a `Variable` where the `Variable` is intended to serve as a placeholder for an `ExprTuple` or `ExprArray`.  It has a *base* which determines the indexing offset, typically $0$ or $1$.  For example, $x_5$ represents the fifth or sixth element of $x$ in *base* $1$ or $0$ respectively.  The *base* is typically not displayed and must be inferred by the theory, though it is explicitly revealed in the <a href=\"#expr_info\">expression information page</a>.  An `Indexed` expression is typically contained within an `Iter` (described next).\n",
    "* <a name=\"iteration\"></a>`Iter`: Represents an iteration of a *parameter* going from a *start* to an *end* in successive unit increments ($+1$).  For example, $x_1 +~\\ldots~+ x_n$ contains an `Iter` of `Indexed` `Variable`.  If we take $n$ to be $3$, this would expand to $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$.  An `Iter` has a *lambda map*, *start index(indices)*, and *end index(indices)*.  In our example, the `Iter` $x_1,~\\ldots,x_n$, is the *operand* of an `proveit.number.addition.Add` `Operation`.  The *lambda map*, *start index* and *end index* of the *iteration* are $i \\mapsto x_i$, $1$, and $n$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prove-It** has an `Expression` class.  The 9 *core types* are classes derived from the `Expression` class.  Each `Expression` object has a class that is one of these 9 *core types* or a class derived from one of these.  This object-oriented approach is convenient for accessing appropriately-named sub-expressions, calling convenient methods to apply **axioms** or **theorems** pertaining to the class, and implementing class-specific automation of obvious derivation steps.

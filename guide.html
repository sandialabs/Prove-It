<p><a name="context"></a><strong>Context Web Pages</strong></p>
<p>Our proofs are organized into <a class="ProveItLink" href="index.html#hierarchy">hierarchy of contexts</a>.  A <strong>context</strong> is a kind of domain of knowledge and these may be interdependent.  Each <strong>context</strong> contains zero or more <strong>common expressions</strong>, <strong>axioms</strong>, and <strong>theorems</strong>.  The <strong>context</strong> web-page has links to one web-page each for the <a href="#common">common expressions</a>, 
<a href="#axioms">axioms</a>, and <a href="#theorems">theorems</a>, as well as a <a href="#demonstrations">demonstrations</a>
web page containing relevant context-specific examples.  <strong>Common expressions</strong> are named <a href="#expr">expressions</a> that may be used when defining <strong>axioms</strong> and <strong>theorems</strong> as well as for convenience in the construction of <strong>theorem</strong> <strong>proofs</strong>, <strong>demonstrations</strong>, and may also be used externally (outside of the <strong>context</strong>).  <strong>Axioms</strong> are named <a href="#knowntruth">known truths</a> that require no proof.  These effectively define context-related operations and mathematical concepts.  <strong>Theorems</strong> are named <a href="#knowntruth">known truths</a> that require a proof.  Each theorem name, on the <strong>theorems</strong> web page, links to its <a href="#proofs">proof</a> page.  <strong>Proofs</strong> may be constructed in any order and have not all been constructed yet.  A <strong>theorem</strong> without a complete <strong>proof</strong> is regarded as <em>unproven</em>.  Each <strong>proof</strong> page links to a <a href="#dependencies">dependencies</a> page which lists all of the <strong>axioms</strong> used directly or indirectly in the proof, as well as any required <em>unproven</em> <strong>theorems</strong>.  It also displays the <strong>theorems</strong> that depend directly upon that one.  The final type of web page that is generated in this library is a web page of <a href="#expr_info">expression information</a> that shows the full tree-like structure of each <strong>expression</strong>.  The <strong>expression information</strong> pages of <strong>axioms</strong> and <strong>theorems</strong> also link to <strong>dependencies</strong> web pages.</p>

<p><a name="expr"></a><strong>Expressions</strong></p>
<p>Mathematical <strong>expressions</strong> are the basic building block of <strong>Prove-It</strong> <a href="#proofs">proofs</a>.  These are represented with rendered LaTeX.  As much as possible, this representation should reflect the internal contents of the <strong>expression</strong> object.  However, to fully understand what is actually being represented by an <strong>expression</strong>, click on the rendered LaTeX to view its <a href="#expr_info">expression information</a> web page.</p>
<p><strong>Expressions</strong> form <a href="#knowntruth">known truths</a> that are used in the derivation steps of a <strong>proof</strong>.  An <strong>expression</strong> has no intrinsic value type, unlike in conventional theorem-proving approaches.  It does have a <em>type</em> that refers to the kind of operation or mathematical object.  There are 9 <em>core types</em> recognized for having specific rules in proof <a href="#proof_deriv">derivations</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="variable"></a><code>Variable</code>: A label that is interchangeable (as long as it is kept distinct from other labels) with no intrinsic meaning.  It is usually represented by a single letter but can have any representation.</li>
<li><a name="literal"></a><code>Literal</code>: A label that is not interchangeable and has an intrinsic meaning.  Specific operators ($\lnot, \land, +, \times$, etc.) and specific irreducibe values ($\top, \bot, 0, 5$, etc.) are all <code>Literal</code>s.  Furthermore, a problem-story <code>Variable</code> in a particular <strong>context</strong>, representing some unknown but particular value, should also be a <code>Literal</code> (e.g., "Ann has $a$ apples...").</li>
<li><a name="operation"></a><code>Operation</code>: The application of <em>operator(s)</em> on <em>operand(s)</em>.  For example, $0 + 5 + 8$ and $1 &lt; a \leq b &lt; 3$ are examples of <em>operation</em> expressions.  The <strong>Prove-It</strong> library defines many <em>types</em> derived from the <em>operation</em> type (e.g., for each specific operation), but the <a href="#proof_deriv">derivation rules</a> only need to know that these are <em>operations</em>.</li>
<li><a name="lambda"></a><code>Lambda</code>: A mapping defined by <em>parameter</em> <code>Variable</code>s transforming to some <em>body</em> <code>Expression</code> but only when the <em>parameter(s)</em> meet certain <em>condition(s)</em>.  For example, $(x, y, z) \mapsto x+y/z~|~x \in \mathbb{R}, y \in \mathbb{R}, z \in \mathbb{R}, z \neq 0$ is a conditional <strong>lambda</strong> that converts three real numbers $x, y, z$ to $x + y/z$ as long as $z$ is not zero.  Note that a <code>Lambda</code> introduces <code>Variables</code> into a new scope via the <em>parameters</em>.  These <em>parameter</em> <code>Variable</code>s are said to be <em>bound</em> in this new scope; occurrences outside this scope are not deemed to be the same thing. There is a special category of <code>Operation</code> types called <code>OperationOverInstances</code> that are essentially functionals acting on a <code>Lambda</code> operand.  $\forall$, $\exists$, $\sum$, and $\prod$ are examples of <code>OperationOverInstances</code>.  For example, $\forall_{x~|~Q(x)} P(x)$ is an expression that translates to "$P(x)$ is true for all values of $x$ for which $Q(x)$ is also true".  Internally, this is represented as an $\forall$ operator acting on the conditional <code>Lambda</code> map $x \mapsto P(x)~|~Q(x)$.</li>
<li><a name="expr_tuple"></a><code>ExprTuple</code>: A list of <code>Expression</code>s that is used, for example, when there are multiple <em>operators</em> or <em>operands</em> of an <code>Operation</code> or multiple <em>parameters</em> of a <code>Lambda</code>.</li>
<li><a name="expr_array"></a><code>ExprArray</code>: A multi-dimensional (e.g., two-dimensional) array of <code>Expression</code>s. This can be used, for example, to represent a quantum circuit which is a two-dimensional graphical representation of a sequence of quantum operations.  A 2-D representation of a matrix is a more basic example.  More work is required to properly implement and test the <em>ExprArray</em> class.</li>
<li><em>NamedExprs</em>: A mapping from keyword strings to <code>Expression</code>s.  This can be used to prevent ambiguity of an expression's internal representation.</li>
<li><a name="indexed"></a><code>Indexed</code>: A particular indexed element of a <code>Variable</code> where the <code>Variable</code> is intended to serve as a placeholder for an <code>ExprTuple</code> or <code>ExprArray</code>.  It has a <em>base</em> which determines the indexing offset, typically $0$ or $1$.  For example, $x_5$ represents the fifth or sixth element of $x$ in <em>base</em> $1$ or $0$ respectively.  The <em>base</em> is typically not displayed and must be inferred by the context, though it is explicitly revealed in the <a href="#expr_info">expression information page</a>.  An <code>Indexed</code> expression is typically contained within an <code>Iter</code> (described next).</li>
<li><a name="iteration"></a><code>Iter</code>: Represents an iteration of a <em>parameter</em> going from a <em>start</em> to an <em>end</em> in successive unit increments ($+1$).  For example, $x_1 +~\ldots~+ x_n$ contains an <code>Iter</code> of <code>Indexed</code> <code>Variable</code>.  If we take $n$ to be $3$, this would expand to $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$.  An <code>Iter</code> has a <em>lambda map</em>, <em>start index(indices)</em>, and <em>end index(indices)</em>.  In our example, the <code>Iter</code> $x_1,~\ldots,x_n$, is the <em>operand</em> of an <code>proveit.number.addition.Add</code> <code>Operation</code>.  The <em>lambda map</em>, <em>start index</em> and <em>end index</em> of the <em>iteration</em> are $i \mapsto x_i$, $1$, and $n$, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prove-It</strong> has an <code>Expression</code> class.  The 9 <em>core types</em> are classes derived from the <code>Expression</code> class.  Each <code>Expression</code> object has a class that is one of these 9 <em>core types</em> or a class derived from one of these.  This object-oriented approach is convenient for accessing appropriately-named sub-expressions, calling convenient methods to apply <strong>axioms</strong> or <strong>theorems</strong> pertaining to the class, and implementing class-specific automation of obvious derivation steps.</p>

<p><a name="expr_info"></a><strong>Expression Information Web Pages</strong></p>
<p>Clicking on generated mathematical <a href="#expr">expression</a> in this library will take you to a 
web page that shows the explicit breakdown of the <strong>expression</strong> into 
a tree-like structure.  The top of the page indicates the <em>type</em> (class)
of expression (again, not to be consued with a type-theory notion of its
value type) with a link to its documentation page. Clicking on the <em>type</em> at the top of this web page will, when this feature is implemented, take you to the code documentation for the <strong>expression's</strong> class.  Currently these are dead links.</p>
<p>The first two notebook inputs of this page show Python code for generating and "checking" the <strong>expression</strong>.  The first input shows the necessary <code>import</code> commands.  The second input builds the <strong>expression</strong> and checks, via <code>%check_expr</code>, that this built expression is consistent with what is stored in a kind of database that <strong>Prove-It</strong> maintains.  The third and final notebook input shows the command to display the <em>expression information</em> of the <strong>expression</strong> object via the <code>exprInfo()</code> method.  Its output is a table with the tree-like structure of the <strong>expression</strong> with all of its <em>sub-expressions</em>.  The first entry, with index "0", is the full <strong>expression</strong>.  Each entry lists the numbers of direct <em>sub-expressions</em> that are always later entries in the table.</p>

<p><a name="knowntruth"></a><strong>Known Truths</strong></p>
<p>A proven statement in <strong>Prove-It</strong> is called a <strong>known truth</strong>.  These are represented in the form: <br/>
{<em>assumption expressions</em>} $\vdash$ <em>truth expression</em><br/>
where the <em>assumption expressions</em> is a comma-delimited list of <a href="#expr">expressions</a> and the <em>truth expression</em> is a single <a href="#expr">expression</a>.  When there are no assumptions, the <strong>known truth</strong> is simply displayed as<br/>
$\vdash$ <em>truth expression</em>
The turnstile symbol, $\vdash$ will hyperlink to the <a href="#proofs">proof</a> of the <strong>known truth</strong>.</p>
<p><a name="unbound"></a>Any <em>unbound</em> <a href="#variable">variable</a> in the <em>assumption expressions</em> and/or <em>truth expression</em> (not <em>bound</em> within the scope of any <a href="#lambda">lambda</a> expression) are deemed to be <em>arbitrary variables</em>. They can represent anything without altering its status as a <strong>known truth</strong>.  This is not the case for <a href="#literal">literals</a> which may only take on a single value (which may or may not be known).</p>
<p>As an example, $\{\lnot A\} \vdash A = \bot$, taking $A$ to be a <em>variable</em>, translates to "any $A$ equals false ($\bot$) assuming the logical negation of $A$ is a true fact".  A main part of <strong>Prove-It's</strong> unique approach is that there is no intrinsic typing system to ensure that $A$ has a <em>Boolean</em> type (true ($\top$) or false ($\bot$) represented as the set $\mathbb{B} = \{\top, \bot\}$).  Rather, it is inferred, in this case for example, from the <em>assumption</em> that the logical negation of $A$ is true.  The logical negation of a value is only defined when that value is a <em>Boolean</em>. Otherwise it simply cannot be evaluated.</p>
<p>New <strong>known truths</strong> may derive from existing <strong>known truths</strong> via <a href="#proof_deriv">derivation rules</a>.  These rules include <a href="#generalization">generalization</a> and <a href="#specialization">specialization</a> which can actualize a change of an <em>unbound</em> <em>variable</em> to any other <strong>expression</strong>.  Taking the previous example, <em>generalizing</em> this <strong>known truth</strong> will derive<br/>
$\vdash \forall_{A~|~\lnot A} A = \bot$.<br/>
This may then be <em>specialized</em> to produce any specific instance of $A$ for which $\lnot A$ is proven or assumed.</p>

<p><a name="proof_deriv"></a><strong>Derivation Rules</strong></p>
<p>New <a href="#knowntruth">known truths</a> may be derived from existing ones, in order to generate a <a href="#proofs">proof</a> of a <a href="#theorems">thereom</a> by using a small number of derivation rules that are available.  These are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Assumption</em>: <br/>
For any <a href="#expr">expression</a> $A$, $A$ is known to be true if $A$ is assumed to be true.  Thus,<br/>
$\{A\} \vdash A$<br/>
Note that the <strong>Prove-It</strong> system is indifferent to whether or not the assumed <strong>expression</strong> is a proper Boolean-type expression.  While it is assumed, it does have a Boolean value (<code>TRUE</code> to be specific), but that does not imply that it has a Boolean type more generally, when it is not assumed.</li>
<li><em>Axiom/theorem invocation</em>:<br/>Introduces a <a href="#knowntruth">known truth</a> from an <a href="#axioms">axiom</a> or <a href="#theorems">theorem</a> and tracks its use in the tracked <a href="#dependencies">dependencies</a>.</li>
<li><em>Axiom/theorem elimination</em>:<br/>Converts <strong>axioms</strong> or <strong>theorems</strong> into assumptions and removes them from the tracked <strong>dependencies</strong>.  <a href="#literal">Literals</a> may be simultaneously converted to <a href="#variable">variables</a> in this process.  This must be done in a fully consistent manner (converting all <strong>axioms</strong>/<strong>theorems</strong> that involve the <em>literal</em> simultanously, and converting all of the <em>literals</em> that the <strong>axioms</strong>/<strong>theorems</strong> involve).  (This has not yet been implemented in the <strong>Prove-It</strong> code.)</li>
<li><em>Hypothetical reasoning</em>:<br/>Given a <strong>known truth</strong> with <em>assumptions</em>, converts any one of the assumptions into an antecedent in an explicit implication.  For example, from<br/>
$\{A, B, C, \ldots\} \vdash Z$<br/>
derive<br/>
$\{A, C, \ldots\} \vdash B \Rightarrow Z$<br/>
Both forms have their use.  Implications are important because they can be nested ("$\vdash$" cannot be nested).  As with <em>assumptions</em>, <strong>Prove-It</strong> is indifferent about whether or not the <em>antecedent</em> and <em>consequent</em> of the <em>implication</em> are Boolean-type expression.  For an <em>implication</em> to be true it only matters that the <em>consequent</em> is true if/when the <em>antecedent</em> is true; if the <em>antecedent</em> has no defined value or is non-Boolean, the <em>implication</em> is vacuously true regardless of whether or not the <em>consequent</em> can be evaluated. </li>
<li><em>Modus ponens</em>:<br/>
From an implication, derive its consequent given that the antecedent is known or assumed to be true.  For example, from<br/>
$\{A, B, C\} \vdash Y \Rightarrow Z$<br/>
and<br/>
$\{B, C, D\} \vdash Y$<br/>
derive<br/>
$\{A, B, C, D\} \vdash Z$<br/>
The <em>assumptions</em> of the resulting <strong>known truth</strong> simply become the union of the <em>assumptions</em> of the prerequisite <strong>known truths</strong>.  Furthermore, either or both of the prerequisite <strong>known truths</strong> may be incorporated in the <em>assumptions</em> list instead of having independent derivations.  For example, the following may be introduced without any prerequisites:<br/>
$\{A, A \Rightarrow B\} \vdash B$<br/></li>
<li><a name="generalization"></a><em>Generalization</em><br/>
As mentioned <a href="#unbound">above</a>, any <em>unbound</em> <a href="#variable">variable</a> in a <strong>known truth</strong> is deemed to be <em>arbitrary</em>.  To transform such a fact into an explicit form, <em>generalization</em> may be used to introduce a universal quantification ($\forall$) over <em>arbitrary</em> <em>variables</em>.  Any of the <em>assumptions</em> of the original <strong>known truth</strong> may be listed as <em>conditions</em> of the universal quantification and removed from the <em>assumptions</em> list. Any <em>assumptions</em> containing the <em>unbound</em> <em>variable(s)</em> must be converted to <em>conditions</em> in this manner because they must be included in the new <em>binding</em> of the <em>variable(s)</em>.  Additional <em>conditions</em> may be added as desired because this can only weaken the <strong>known truth</strong>.  As an example, suppose we have a <strong>known truth</strong> of the form<br/>
$\{x \in S, Q(x)\} \vdash P(x)$,<br/>
where $Q(x)$ and $P(x)$ take the place of <strong>expressions</strong> involving $x$ as an <em>unbound</em> <em>variable</em> and $S$ may be any <strong>expression</strong> but should be a properly defined set in order for $x \in S$ to evaluate to true for any $x$.  We can then derive, via <em>generalization</em>,<br/>
$\vdash \forall_{x \in S~|~Q(x)} P(x)$.<br/>
Note that the $x \in S$ notation of this universal quantification is a shorthand LaTeX representation in place of $\forall_{x~|~x \in S, Q(x)}$ but internally $x \in S$ is treated as a <em>condition</em> in the same manner as $Q(x)$.  This is a simple, single-<em>variable</em> example, but multiple <em>variables</em>, in fact, may be <em>generalized</em> simultaneously.  Also, multiple nested $\forall$ operations may be introduced simultaneously.</li>
<li><a name="specialization"></a><em>Specialization</em> and <em>relabeling</em><br/>
<em>Specialization</em> is the reverse of <em>generalization</em>.  It can transform a <strong>known truth</strong> with explicit universal quantification into a <strong>known truth</strong> with fewer $\forall$ operations.  For example, given<br/>
$\{A, B\} \vdash \forall_{x~|~Q(x)} P(x),$<br/>
and<br/>
$\{B, C\} \vdash Q(x)$<br/>
we can derive<br/>
$\{A, B, C\} \vdash P(x)$,<br/>
As with <em>modus ponens</em>, the new <em>assumptions</em> are the union of the prerequisite <em>assumption</em> and there is flexibility in what is included in the <em>assumptions list</em> versus other <strong>known truths</strong>.  For example, <br/>
$\{ \forall_{x~|~Q(x)} P(x), Q(x)\} \vdash P(x)$<br/>
may be derived without any prerequisites.  Of course, in the <em>specialization</em> process, $x$ may be replaced with any expression, as long as it does not violate scoping restrictions of <a href="#lambda">lambda</a> <strong>expression</strong>.  That is, the <em>unbound</em> <em>variables</em> in the replacement of $x$ cannot be the same as any <em>parameter</em> of a <em>lambda</em> that contains an instance of <em>x</em> in the original <strong>known truth</strong>.  For example, from<br/>
$\vdash \forall_{x} \exists_{y}~y=x,$<br/>
we <strong>can</strong> derive<br/>
$\vdash \exists_{y}~y=5$,<br/>
but we <strong>cannot</strong> derive<br/>
$\vdash \exists_{y}~y=y+5$.<br/>
Multiple <em>variables</em> and even multiple nested $\forall$ operations may be <em>specialized</em> simultaneously and some <em>variables</em> may be <em>relabeled</em> instead.  The difference between <em>specializing</em> and <em>relabeling</em> is that the corresponding $\forall$ is not eliminated in the case of <em>relabeling</em> but the <em>variable</em> may only be replaced with another <em>variable</em>.  This could be accomplished via <em>specializing</em> and then <em>generalization</em> but can also be done in one step via <em>relabeling</em>.
<br/><br/>
Finally, there are special <em>specialization</em> rules involving <a href="#iteration">iterations</a> and <a href="#indexed">indexed</a> <strong>expression</strong>.  Specifically, when the <em>variable</em> of an <em>indexed</em> <strong>expression</strong> is replaced, via specialization, with an <a href="#expr_tuple">expression list</a> or <a href="#expr_array">expression tensor</a>, the indexing must be performed, replacing the <em>indexed</em> expression with the particular <em>indexed</em> value (or an exception raised if it cannot be performed); and when the <em>indexed</em> <strong>expression</strong> is contained within an <em>iteration</em>, the <em>iteration</em> must be expanded to reveal each particular <em>indexed</em> value.  For example, when <em>specializing</em><br/>
$\vdash \forall_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \forall_{x, y_1, \ldots, y_n \in \mathbb{C}}~x \cdot (y_1 + \ldots + y_n) = x \cdot y_1 + \ldots x \cdot + y_n$<br/>
(the distribution law) with $n \mapsto 3$, $x \mapsto x$, and $y \mapsto [a, b, c]$, we can derive<br/>
$\{x \in \mathbb{C}, a \in \mathbb{C}, b \in \mathbb{C}, c \in \mathbb{C} \} \vdash x \cdot (a + b + c) = x \cdot a + x \cdot b + x \cdot c$.<br/>  In this example, the <em>indexed</em> <strong>expressions</strong> use <em>base</em> one, implicit in the LaTeX representation but explicit in the internal representation.  To expand the <em>iteration</em>, <strong>Prove-It</strong> applies $+1$ to the <em>start index</em> successively until reaching the <em>end index</em>, performing evaluations along the way.  The derivation step requires these evaluation <strong>known truths</strong> as prerequisites.  In this example,<br/>
$\vdash 1+1=2$ and $\vdash 2+1=3$<br/>
are prerequisites.</li>

<p>The <code>dependencies</code> link on a <a href="#proofs">proof web page</a> or on the <a href="#expr_info">expression information web page</a> of an <a href="#axioms">axiom</a> or <a href="#theorems">theorem</a> will take you a web page that shows <strong>dependencies</strong> for the corresponding <strong>axiom</strong> or <strong>theorem</strong>.  For <strong>theorem</strong> <strong>dependencies</strong>, this page lists all the <strong>axioms</strong> used directly or indirectly in the <strong>proof</strong> as well as any dependent <strong>theorems</strong> that have not yet been proven.  Additionally, for both <strong>axiom</strong> and <strong>theorem</strong> <strong>dependency</strong> pages, it lists all of the <strong>theorems</strong> that directly depend on that <strong>axiom</strong>/<strong>theoreom</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>demonstrations</strong> web page of a <strong>context</strong> shows examples of how to use the operations and concepts defined in the <strong>context</strong> and should test automation capabilities.  It is a useful regression testing tool as well as a tutorial for using what is defined in the <strong>context</strong>.  Many of these have not been generated yet or are incomplete at this time.</p>

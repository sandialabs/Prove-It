    "<a href=\"https://github.com/PyProveIt/Prove-It\">Prove-It</a> is a tool for proving and organizing general theorems using Python.  These web pages are a companion to the **Prove-It** code repository, generated using this code to display the proofs contained therein, in addition to the <a href=\"doc/html/index.html\">documentation</a>.  This system is in an early beta version and under active development.  A tutorial and more complete explanation of **Prove-It**'s unique approach to theorem proving is in progress.\n",

    "Our proofs are organized into a <a href=\"#hierarchy\">hierarchy of contexts</a> as listed below.  This is an expanding and evolving library with the eventual aim of accepting proofs from many contributors.  There is a particular structure to this library described in this <a class=\"ProveItLink\" href=\"brief_guide.ipynb\">brief guide</a>.  The links below go to corresponding <a class=\"ProveItLink\" href=\"brief_guide.ipynb#context\">context</a> web pages.  Each of these contains context-specific links to web pages for <a class=\"ProveItLink\" href=\"brief_guide.ipynb#common\">common expressions</a>, \n",
    "<a class=\"ProveItLink\" href=\"brief_guide.ipynb#axioms\">axioms</a>, and <a class=\"ProveItLink\" href=\"brief_guide.ipynb#theorems\">theorems</a>, as well as a page of <a class=\"ProveItLink\" href=\"brief_guide.ipynb#demonstrations\">demonstrations</a> containing relevant examples.  Additionally, each generated expression links to an <a class=\"ProveItLink\" href=\"brief_guide.ipynb#expr_info\">expression information</a> page that shows the internal tree-like structure of the expression.  Each theorem links to its <a class=\"ProveItLink\" href=\"brief_guide.ipynb#proof\">proof</a>, though not all proofs have been generated.  This content is very much incomplete.  The earlier contexts listed below tend to be more complete than the later ones.  The <a class=\"ProveItLink\" href=\"packages/proveit/logic/equality/_context_.ipynb\">proveit.logic.equality</a> context has the best example of an ideal <a class=\"ProveItLink\" href=\"packages/proveit/logic/equality/_demonstrations_.ipynb\">demonstrations</a> page."

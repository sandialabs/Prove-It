    "Chapter 2.b.iv.  Instantiation\n",
    "=======\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instantiation** is a powerful derivation rule that can transform judgments with great flexibility by implicitly invoking *Lambda application* (beta reduction).  It is based upon the fact that variables can represent anything and, therefore, we may replace each free variable in an existing judgment with any expression, as long as we do so consistently.  That is, we may replace any free variable on either side of the turnstile of a judgment with any expression, as long as we replace all occurrences of the free variable across the judgment in a consistent manner.  Implicitly, if a judgment is valid, any such transformation must be allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more precise about the machinery, an ad-hoc Lambda expression is generated for each component of the judgment (each assumption as well as the right side) with the respective component becoming the body of the corresponding Lambda expression.  The parameters of each of these ad-hoc lambda expressions will be the same and are dictacted by which variables are to be replaced.  Then beta reduction is applied using operands dictated by the desired replacements, the same operands for each ad-hoc lambda expression, with all of the reduction rules discussed in previous chapters.  The reduced expressions form a new judgment.  For example, some $\\{A(x)\\} \\vdash P(x)$ where $x$ is a variable can be transformed to some $\\{A(t)\\} \\vdash P(t)$ where $t$ is an arbitrary expression via applying the ad-hoc lambda expressions, $x \\mapsto A(x)$ and $x \\mapsto P(x)$, to the operand $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Assumptions* may be provided when performing an instantiation.  These may be needed to satisfy *requirements* needed to validate any reductions when performing the lambda applications.  Such requirements then become requirements of the derivation step, creating additional dependencies (beyond that of the original judgment) in the proof graph.  Assumptions that were needed to fulfill these requirements will be added as assumptions in the new judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, and importantly, instantiation may be used to eliminate any number of outer universal quantifiers on the right side of the turnstile provided that the conditions of the quantifiers are satisfied under these replacements.  These also become *requirements* of the derivation step to be included in the proof graph and may need *assumptions* to be proven.  For example, we can instantiate $A \\vdash \\forall_{x~|~Q_1(x), Q_2(x)} P(x)$ to get $A \\cup B \\vdash P(t)$ provided $A \\cup B \\vdash Q_1(t)$ and $A \\cup B \\vdash Q_2(t)$ are provable."

    "Let us be explicit about the algorithm applied when we perform an **instantiation** that eliminates univeral quantifiers, which may involve ranges of parameters.  As we described in the first part of this chapter, an ad-hoc lambda map is created and applied to different parts of the judgment.  This is done to transform assumptions as before.  On the right side of the turnstile, as we eliminate universal quantification, we first create and apply an ad-hoc lambda map for each of its parameter entries (in case there are indices of a parameter range that must be instantiated), then we create and apply an ad-hoc lambda map to each condition (adding those outcomes to our list of *requirements*).  After eliminating all of the desired universal quantifications in that manner, we then create and apply an ad-hoc lambda map to the remaining inner expression.  For the most part, we use the same parameters and operands for each of these ad-hoc lambda maps as before, but the following are exceptions: the ad-hoc lambda map for a parameter entry of an eliminated universal quantifier excludes any entry involving the corresponding parameter variable, and an implicit instantiation is converted to an explicit form after encountering the corresponding explicit range of parameters.\n",

    "Each `Expression` object has a class that is derived one of the \"primitive\" `Expression` classes listed below (each of which is derived from `proveit._core_.expression.expr.Expression`).  These \"primitive\" types of expressions, in the order that we discuss them below, are:\n",
    "* <a href=\"#Variable\">`Variable`</a>: A label that is interchangeable (as long as it is kept distinct from different labels) with no intrinsic meaning.  It is often represented by a single letter ($a$, $b$, $x$, $y$, etc.) but can have any representation.\n",
    "* <a href=\"#Literal\">`Literal`</a>: A label that is not interchangeable and has an intrinsic meaning.  Specific operators ($\\lnot, \\land, +, \\times$, etc.) and specific irreducible values ($\\top, \\bot, 0, 5$, etc.) are all `Literal`s.  Furthermore, a problem-story `Variable` in a particular theory package, representing some unknown but particular value, should also be a `Literal` (e.g., \"Ann has $a$ apples...\").\n",
    "* <a href=\"#ExprTuple\">`ExprTuple`</a>: A list of `Expression`s that is used, for example, when there are multiple *operators* or *operands* of an `Operation`, or multiple *parameters* of a `Lambda`.\n",
    "* <a href=\"#Operation\">`Operation`</a>: The application of *operator(s)* on *operand(s)*.  For example, $0 + 5 + 8$ and $1 < a \\leq b < 3$ are examples of *operation* expressions.  The **Prove-It** library defines many *types* derived from the *operation* type (e.g., for each specific operation), but all *operations* have the same behavior with respect to reduction rules that will be described in a later tutorial.\n",
    "* <a href=\"#Conditional\">`Conditional`</a>: An expression that has one *condition* and one *value*.  The **Conditional** is reducible to its *value* if and only if the *value* is true.  For example $\\{P(x) \\textrm{ if } Q(x).$ reduces to $P(x)$ if $Q(x)$ is true.  Otherwise, the **Conditional** is not defined (i.e., it is not reducible).\n",
    "* <a href=\"#Lambda\">`Lambda`</a>: A mapping defined by *parameter* `Variable`s (and/or *iterations* of *indexed variables* described below with the `Iter` and `IndexedVar` core classes) transforming to some *body* `Expression`.  For example, $(x, y, z) \\mapsto \\{x+y/z~|~(x \\in \\mathbb{R}) \\land (y \\in \\mathbb{R}) \\land (z \\in \\mathbb{R}) \\land (z \\neq 0)\\}$ is a `Lambda` with a `Conditional` *body* that converts three real numbers $x, y, z$ to $x + y/z$ as long as $z$ is not zero.  Note that a `Lambda` introduces `Variables` into a new scope via the *parameters*.  These *parameter* `Variable`s are said to be *bound* in this new scope; occurrences outside this scope are not deemed to be the same thing. There is a special category of `Operation` types called `OperationOverInstances` that are essentially functionals acting on a `Lambda` operand.  $\\forall$, $\\exists$, $\\sum$, and $\\prod$ are examples of `OperationOverInstances`.  For example, $\\forall_{x~|~Q(x)} P(x)$ is an expression that translates to \"$P(x)$ is true for all values of $x$ for which $Q(x)$ is also true\".  Internally, this is represented as an $\\forall$ operator acting on the `Lambda` map with a `Conditional` *body*: $x \\mapsto \\{P(x)~|~Q(x)\\}$.\n",
    "* <a href=\"#NamedExprs\">`NamedExprs`</a>: A mapping from keyword strings to `Expression`s.  This can be used to prevent ambiguity of an expression's internal representation.\n",
    "* <a href=\"#ExprRange\">`ExprRange`</a>: Represents a range of expressions with a *parameter* going from a *start* index to an *end* index in successive unit increments ($+1$).  It contains a `Lambda` to define each expression in the range as a function of the *parameter* value (the index).\n",
    "For example, $1/(x+i) + ... + 1/(x+j)$ is essentially an `Operation` with `+` as the *operator* and an `ExprRange` as the *operand*.  This `ExprRange` in this case is $1/(x+i), ..., 1/(x+j)$.  The sub-expression of this `ExprRange` may be denoted as $k \\mapsto \\{1/(x+k)~|~k \\in i .. j\\}$ where $k$ is an arbitrary `Lambda` *parameter* and $i .. j$ denotes an integer interval. \n",
    "* <a href=\"#IndexedVar\">`IndexedVar`</a>: A special kind of `Operation` that indexes a `Variable`.  It treats the `Variable` being indexed as the *operator* and the *index* as the *operand*.  For example: $a_1$, $x_i$, $x_{i+1}$, etc.  An *iteration* if *indexed* *variables* acts as a collection of labels, however.  For example: $a_1, ..., a_n$ is a collection of $n$ labels and can be used as *parameters* of a `Lambda` map and has special substitution rules in which an `Iter` may be expanded to multiple entries within an `ExprTuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These \"primitive\" types are special for the following reason.  In order to automatically or manually verify the correctness of a proof in **Prove-It**, one is only required to know the primitive base class of the expressions in the expression DAGs involved in the proof.  The way that the expression is to be formatted may be defined by the derived class, but this is a dressing which is not actually verified by **Prove-It** in any way.  For this reason, in order to really understand the axioms that were used in a proof, or understand what was actually proven, one must view the full expression DAG and understand its structure with respect to the primitive types."

The most common \"primitive\" type used as a base class is the `Operation`; there are a wide variety of kinds of operations (logical operations such as $\\land$, $\\lor$, $\\lnot$, etc.; the $\\forall$ and $\\exists$ quantifiers, number operations such as $+$, $-$, etc.).

    "* <a href=\"#OperationOverInstances\">`OperationOverInstances`</a>: An `Operation` whose operand is a `Lambda` expression.  Often, these `Lambda` expression has a `Conditional` body.  The idea is that it operates over the domain of instances of the `Lambda` parameter variables for the the *condition* of the `Conditional` is satisfied.  Quantifiers are `OperationOverInstances`.  $\\forall_{x, y~|~Q(x, y)} P(x, y)$ is internally represented by Prove-It as an operation of the $\\forall$ operator acting on $(x, y) \\mapsto \\left\\{P(x, y) \\textrm{ if } Q(x, y)\\right.$.  $\\sum_{k = 1}^{N} f(x)$ is internally represented by Prove-It as an operation of the $\\sum$ operator acting on $k \\mapsto \\left\\{f(x) \\textrm{ if } k \\in 1 .. N\\right.$.\n",
    "* <a href=\"#ConditionalSet\">`ConditionalSet`</a>: An expression that has one or more *conditions* with associated *values*.  For example, consider this definition for the absolute value of an integer: $\\{x~\\textrm{ if }~x \\geq 0; -x~\\textrm{ if }~x < 0.$ A *value* is only pertinent if its associated *condition* is satisfied (a **judgment**).  Via axioms, a `Conditional` equates to one of its *values* if its associated *condition* is proven the be true and all of its other *conditions* are proven to false.  With respect to substitution rules, the substitution of a *value* may utilize the fact that its *condition* must be satisfied in order to be pertinent, and therefore its *condition* may be assumed within the context of performing substution for the *value*."

Ideally, the formatting should be in direct correspondence with the structure of the `Expression` as a true reflection of the internal representation, but there is no enforcement mechanism to ensure that this is the case.  Users are advised to inspect the fully explicit expression DAGs of important axioms and theorems (or rely on crowdsource checking).

    "* *Equality substitution*: using the `substitution` axiom of `proveit.logic.equality` to prove that $f(x) = f(y)$ given $x = y$.  This uses *instantiation* of the `substitution` axiom which states $\\forall_{f, x, y~|~x=y}~(f(x) = f(y))$.

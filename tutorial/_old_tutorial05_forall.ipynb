    "==================\n",
    "\n",
    "Universal quantification is another core concept in **Prove-It**.  A `Forall` operation, formatted with the $\\forall$ symbol, is used to represent universal quantification.  For example, $\\forall_x P(x)$ means that $P(x)$ is true for any instance of $x$.  $P(x)$ holds true universally over instances of $x$.  Like `Implies`, `Forall` is a core concept but is defined outside of the core in the `proveit.logic` package. It is known in the core for use in the *instantiation* and *generalization* derivation steps discussed below.\n",

    "*Generalization* is the \"inverse\" of *instantiation* just as *hypothetical reasoning* was the \"inverse\" of *modus ponens*.  We can write these derivation rules in a manner that makes this relationship clear (just as we did for *hypothetical reasoning* and *modus ponens*):\n",

    "There is some asymmetry between *instantiation* and *generalization*.  $\\clubsuit$ here is meant to represent *any* **expression**, not necessarily a **variable**, as long is it does not violate scoping restrictions (*e.g.*, having a free **variable** that is the same as a **lambda** *parameter* within the $P$ or $Q$ functions).  However, *generalization* only applies to an unbound **variable**.  In Prove-It, an unbound **variable** is regarded as an \"arbitrary\" variable.  Essentially, it is implicitly universally quantified.  Recall that *modus ponens* converts an explicit antecedent to an implicit assumption and *hypothetical reasoning* does the opposite.  Similarly, *instantiation* converts an explicit universal quantification to implicit arbitrary variables and *generalization* does the opposite.  The reason for having the explicit and implicit forms is much the same as it was for the antecedent versus assumption.  The explicit form allows nesting but the implicit form provides direct access to the instance expression.  Furthermore, explicit universal quantification offers the power of being able to *instantiate* an instance variable to an arbitrary **expression**.\n",

    "The **Equals** expression class is defined outside the core in `proveit.logic.equality`.  It does not have any special reduction rule of its own.  However, equality is understood in the core derivation system in a few senses.  Equality is used for requirements when there are a range of lambda parameters and the length of the operands must *equal* the length of the parameter range.  Also, tuples of indices need to be *equal* when performing parameter-depdendent **ExprRange** expansions.  In addition to this, automatic reductions may be effected by *any* expression class via equality.  This can be used to perform any kind of reduction during lambda application (or instantiation, which uses lambda application) with just the requirement that the original sub-expression is equal to the *reduced* sub-expression.  For best practices, however, this should only make obvious reductions in which notation is otherwise awkward and generally unnecessary rather than being used for general simplification.  For example, logical `and`/`or` applied to zero operands or one operand is reduced via $[\\land]() = \\top$ (`and` applied to zero operands is `TRUE`), $\\forall_{A \\in \\mathbb{B}} [\\land](A) = A$ (`and` applied to one operand reduces to just that operand if it is a boolean), $[\\lor]() = \\bot$ (`or` applied to zero operands is `FALSE`), $\\forall_{A \\in \\mathbb{B}} [\\lor](A) = A$ (`or` applied to one operand reduces to just that operand if it is a boolean).  The left side of these equations may emerge in the process of a lambda application (or instantiation) but should be immediately reduced to the right side when possible.  Although it is possible to enable/disable these automatic reductions for each expression class independently, general simplification should be done explicitly (not using this automation) so the user has full and explicit control as they perform they precise derivations they want to attain.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Conditional** expression is a core expression type with one special reduction rule.  Specifically, the condition of the **Conditional** may be introduced as an internal assumption in the process of performing a lambda application (or instantiation).  Conditionals are used implicitly in the conditions of quantifiers.  For example, $\\forall_{x~|~Q(x)} P(x)$ is internally represented as an operation with the $\\forall$ operator applied to the lambda expression $x \\mapsto \\left\\{P(x) \\textrm{ if } Q(x)\\right..$, where $\\left\\{P(x) \\textrm{ if } Q(x)\\right..$ is a **Conditional** expression, defined to be $P(x)$ when $Q(x)$ is `TRUE` but otherwise undefined for any practical purpose.  Since the $P(x)$ value of the **Conditional** is only relevant when $Q(x)$ is `TRUE`, we can freely add $Q(x)$ to the *assumptions* when making replacements of the $P(x)$ expression in the process of performing lambda application (or instantiation)."

The purpose of marking these requirements is to make it simple to verify **Prove-It** proofs independently.  A checker should not need to know what \"equality replacements\" are available or which ones should be employed for any particular derivation step.  That would not be appropriate since \"equality replacements\" may be defined outside of the core and may be enabled/disabled at will.  All other derivation step requirements are known according to the core derivation rules which an independent checker will need to understand, but these rules are intended to be finite and stable.  When it comes to the \"equality replacements,\" however, the checker simply needs to note that the marked (`*`-ed) requirements should be used to replace matching occurrences of the left side of the equalities with the respective right side in a straightforward manner."

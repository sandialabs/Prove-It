    "\n",
    "As we saw, **instantiation** may be used to eliminate universal quantifiers.  Introducing universal quantifiers in a judgment is accomplished via **generalization**.  To a certain extent, these are inverse procedures.  You can instantiate $A \\vdash \\forall_{x~|~Q_1(x), Q_2(x)} P(x)$ to get $A \\cup B \\vdash P(t)$ provided $A \\cup B \\vdash Q_1(t)$ and  $A \\cup B \\vdash Q_2(t)$ are provable.  You can generalize  $A \\cup \\{Q_1(x), Q_2(x)\\} \\vdash P(x)$ to get $A \\vdash \\forall_{x~|~Q_1(x), Q_2(x)} P(x)$ provided the expressions in $A$ do not have $x$ as a free variable.  Essentially, these convert between implicit and explicit forms of universal quantification.  Free variables of a judgment may be instantiated to anything as long as it is consistent across its the judgment (both sides of the turnstile); in that sense, there is an implicit universal quantification.  With **generalization**, you can make universal quantification of any number of parameters explicit, binding the parameters within the $\\forall$ operation.  The only caveat is that assumptions of the original judgment than contain any of the newly quantified variables must move to the right side of the turnstile and become conditions of the $\\forall$ operation so they can be properly bound, consistent with the other occurrences.  In our example, $Q_1(x)$ and $Q_2(x)$ were assumptions that became conditions of the new quantifer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules and mechanisms of **generalization** are very simple and versatile.  You can parameterize any variables, over any range of indices, and introduce any conditions (more conditions will only make the statement weaker and therefore no less derivable) with the only caveat that assumptions containing any of the new parameter variables must be in the conditions of the new quantifier.  Assumptions are eliminated when they appear as conditions.  For convenience, any number of nested $\\forall$ operations may be introduced in one derivation step, but the effect is the same as if they were introduced one at a time."

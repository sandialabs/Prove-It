    "In **Prove-It**, proving an **expression** to be a true statement under some set of assumptions creates a **known truth** object and a **proof** object.  **Prove-It**, in its core, is agnostic to intrinsic truth-aptness of **expressions** except when they are proven and become \"known truths\".  The `proveit.logic` package defines the Boolean concept which may be used for making statements of the form $A \\in \\mathbb{B}$ (where $\\mathbb{B}$ represents the Boolean set of True or False), but this is outside **Prove-It**'s core.  As far as the core is concerned, an **expression** is either proven or not. If an expression is not proven, it may or may not be truth-apt (*i.e.*, it may or may not be able to be shown to be true in some context)."

    "A **known truth** contains assumptions, as **expressions**, and the single **expression** that is known to be a true statement under these assumptions.  It also has an associated **proof**.  The associated **proof** may get updated over time with a stronger proof (fewer assumption requirements) or newer proof that is as strong and has fewer proof steps.  A **proof** may also be disabled (via its `disable` method) to force an alternate or avoid its use.  Conveniently, a **known truth** object accesses the methods of the underlying proven **expression** seamlessly.  Using Python tricks (specifically, overloading the `__getattr__` and `__dir__` methods), the **known truth** behaves in most ways as if it were the known true **expression** it is wrapping.  This is useful because **expression** objects typically have convenience methods that are specific to the kind of expression, but it is also nice to display the object as a **known truth** (discussed next)."

    "**Operation** is the base class for most of the **Expression** classes defined in the **Prove-It** theory systems.  An **Operation** represents *operator(s)* acting upon *operand(s)*.  $1 + 5 - 1$, $1 < k \\leq l$, and $x_1 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot x_n$ are a few examples of expressions that can be represented by classes derived from **Operation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are essentially two kinds of reduction rules specific to **Operation** expressions when the operation itself is to be replaced, rather than just its operator and/or operand(s):\n",
    "1. *Explicit operation replacement* is performed by replacing an operator with a **Lambda** expression.  In that case, the operation is replaced by the result of applying thislambda mapping to the operands (an internal beta reduction).  For example, $P(x, y)$ with $P:[(a, b) \\mapsto a+b]$ becomes $x + y$.\n",
    "2. *Implicit operation replacement* is performed by replacing an operator with a designated **Literal** operator of an **Operation** class.  In that case, the operation is replaced by one of that derived class rather than the **Operation** class. For example, $P(x, y)$ with $P:+$ becomes $x + y$ with the correct `Add` type rather than a generic **Operation** type."

Each of these may either be an **ExprTuple** or it represents a singular operator/operand.

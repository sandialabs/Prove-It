    "=======\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operation** is the base class for most of the **Expression** classes defined in the **Prove-It** theory systems.  An **Operation** represents *operator(s)* acting upon *operand(s)*.  $1 + 5 - 1$, $1 < k \\leq l$, and $x_1 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot x_n$ are a few examples of expressions that can be represented by classes derived from **Operation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are essentially two kinds of reduction rules specific to **Operation** expressions that are applied in the process of performing a lambda application (beta reduction).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Operation replacement*: The operation itself may be replaced, rather than just its operator(s) and/or operand(s), in two different ways.\n",
    "    1. *Explicit operation replacement* is performed by replacing an operator with a **Lambda** expression.  In that case, the operation is replaced by the result of applying thislambda mapping to the operands (an internal beta reduction).  For example, $P(x, y)$ with $P:[(a, b) \\mapsto a+b]$ becomes $x + y$.\n",
    "    2. *Implicit operation replacement* is performed by replacing an operator with a designated **Literal** operator of an **Operation** class.  In that case, the operation is replaced by one of that derived class rather than the **Operation** class. For example, $P(x, y)$ with $P:+$ becomes $x + y$ with the correct `Add` type rather than a generic **Operation** type.\n",
    "2. *Arity protection*: As an artifact of allowing either a single operand or multiple operands represented by an **ExprTuple**, rather than always having the operand(s) be an **ExprTuple**, we need to treat the following cases as special reduction rules.\n",
    "    1. The **Operation** has a single operand that is replaced by an **ExprTuple**.  It must become an operation with a single **ExprTuple** operand rather than multiple operands.  For example, $f(x)$ with $x:(a, b, c)$ becomes $f((a, b, c))$ rather than $f(a, b, c)$.\n",
    "    2. The **Operation** has an **ExprTuple** of multiple operands in an **ExprRange** that collapses to a single operand.  The outer **ExprTuple** must be eliminated consistent with haveing a single operand.  For example, $f(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$ with $n:1$ becomes $f(x_1)$ rather than $f((x_1))$."

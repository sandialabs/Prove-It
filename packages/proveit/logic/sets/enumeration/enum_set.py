    Defines an enumerated set (i.e. a set with explicitly-listed
    elements). For example, one could use Set(one, two, three) to
    produce the enumerated set {1, 2, 3} or Set(a, b, a) to produce
    the enumerated set {a, b, a}. Although repeated elements can be
    specified and will appear in output expressions, the Set is
    interpreted as a set and not a multiset --- thus, e.g., we have
    {a, b, a} = {a, b} and the cardinality of an enumerated Set such
    as {a, b, a} should be the cardinality of the underlying support
    {a, b}.

        This proper subset method is more complex than the analogous
        method for improper subsets. As with the improper subset case,
        this process is complicated by the fact that the Set class
        allows for multiplicity of elements without it actually
        representing a multi-set (thus, for example, {a, a} = {a}).
        Subset deductions are based on the support sets (i.e. the sets
        with all multiplicities reduced to 1) for the self
        and subsets supplied. The process is further complicated by
        the fact that elements in one set might not *appear* to be in
        the other set but might be *equal* to elements in the other set,
        making it challenging to confirm the proper subset relationship.

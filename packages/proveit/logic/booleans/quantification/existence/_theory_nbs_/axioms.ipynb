That is, \"there exists appropriately constrained operands of $P$ for which the $P$ operation is true\" means that \"it is *not* the case that all appropriately constrained operands of $P$ cause the $P$ operation to *not* evaluate to true\".  This is expressed in a way that does not assume that the $P$ operation returns a Boolean, exploiting the fact that `Equals` ($=$) is defined to always evaluate to a Boolean and therefore `NotEquals` ($\\neq$) as well.  Existence in this theory means that the $P$ operation evaluates to true for some instance of appropriately constrained operands but it does not mean that the $P$ operation always evaluates to a Boolean under this constraint."

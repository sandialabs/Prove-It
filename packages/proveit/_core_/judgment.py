A Judgment represents an expression that has been proven to be a true
statement.  A Judgment wraps an Expression (acting like the Expression
in many ways via overloading __getattr__) but also has a list of assumptions
and its proof (as a Proof object, which may be updated if a newer proof,
with possibly fewer assumptions, suffices).

        quantified immediately to the right of the Judgment turnstile
        according to the "replacement" map (repl_map), eliminating the 
        quantifier as the corresponding variables are instantiated.
        It may eliminate any number of nested Forall operations, 
        instantiating the instance Variables according to repl_map, 
        going to the depth for which the instance variables occur as 
        keys in repl_map or according to num_forall_eliminations if it
        is specified.
        
        For Variables that map to Variables in the replacement map,
        this is handled as a relabeling across both sides of the
        turnstile as well as "internal" Lambda map parameters.
        For Variables that map to non-Variables, the replacement only
        occurs within an eliminated quantifier and will not penetrate 
        into internal Lambda maps that use that Variable as a parameter. 
        
        Replacements are made simultaneously.  For example, the 
        {x:y, y:x} mapping will swap x and y variables.
        
        If equality 'replacements' are specified or 'auto_simplify'
        is True (in proveit.defaults which may be temporarily set
        via keyword arguments), equality replacements may be made
        in the process via equality judgements where the left-hand-side
        is the expression being replaced and the right-hand-side is the
        replacement.

        If simplify_only_where_marked= is True, Prove-It will only 
        simplify "marked" parts of an expression.  
        'markers_and_marked_expr' must then be a tuple: Variable 
        markers, and an expression that matches pre-simplified 
        instantiated expression except where marked with the markers.
        Only sub-expressions containing a marker may be simplified
        (if auto_simplify=True).

        are converted to variables (with the same formatting), 
        corresponding axioms and/or theorems are converted to 
        assumptions, and these variables are then generalized in one 
        step.  To do this, simply supply Literal expressions in place of
        Variables in the forall_var_or_vars_or_var_lists.  There may
        even be a mixture of Literals and Variables.  There are 
        important limitations regarding literal generalization.  There 
        must not be any axiom or theorem requirement using that Literal
        that isn't masked by a condition, or a 
        LiteralGeneralizationFailure will be raised.  That is, *all* 
        needed axioms/theorems which use that Literal must be converted 
        to an assumption (with the Literal converted to a Variable) and 
        then included in the conditions (or antecedent).

        If an antecedent is provided, it plays the role of an extra
        condition but is placed in an implication instead of a
        Conditional.

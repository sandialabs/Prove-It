"""
A Judgment represents an expression that has been proven to be a true
statement.  A Judgment wraps an Expression (acting like the Expression
in many ways via overloading __getattr__) but also has a list of assumptions
and its proof (as a Proof object, which may be updated if a newer proof,
with possibly fewer assumptions, suffices).

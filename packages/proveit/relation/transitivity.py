"""
A TransitiveRelation is a generic base class for binary
relationships that are transitive.  Less than and greater than
relationships are examples (so are subset and superset relationships).
For example, transitivity in the "less than" theory means that
a<b and b<c implies that a<c.  The "equivalence class"
(proveit.logic.Equals by default) is special kind of TransitiveRelation
that is also symmetric; that is, y=x if x=y.
proveit.logic.Equals is a TransitiveRelation, but
overloads the default methods.  The TransitiveRelation class
provides convenient automation capabilities for performing
a transitive search to conclude a new relation from known relations
using transitivity rules.  To enable this, each TransitiveRelation
needs to track to define known_left_sides and known_right_sides as
class dictionaries; these will be populated as side effects for
each proven relation (see derive_side_effects).  Also, the
apply_transitivity method should be appropriately implemented.
The default version handles the case when the "other" relation
is an equality (in which case, substitution may simply be performed).

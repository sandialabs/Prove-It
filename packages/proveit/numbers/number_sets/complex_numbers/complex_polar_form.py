    Given an expression, expr, of the complex number polar form,
        r * exp(i * theta),
    or something obviously equivalent to this, where r and theta are 
    Real (and r is preferably RealNonNeg) under the given assumptions, 
    return
        (r, theta)
    as a tuple pair. If automation=False, the r and theta must
    already be known to be RealNonNeg and Real respectively. If
    automation=True, we may attempt to prove these through automation.
    
    If radius_must_be_nonneg and nonneg_radius_preferred are False, 
    we won't worry about ensuring that r is non-negative (so the result
    can be ambiguous).  If radius_must_be_nonneg is True, a ValueError
    will be raised if we can't convert to a form where r is known to be
    non-negative.
    
    If expr is not exactly in this complex number polar form and
    'reductions' is provided as a set, add to the 'reductions' set
    an equation that equates the exact form on the left with the
    original form on the right.  This may be useful to use as
    'reductions' in instantiations of theorems that employ the
    complex number polar form so it may perform proper reductions
    to the desired form.  For example, if expr=5 is provided,
    the added reduction will be
        5 * exp(i * 0) = 5.
    
    If do_include_unit_length_reduction is True, and we will included
    reductions so that it will reduction from the unit length
    form as well.  For example, if expr=1 is provided, the added
    reductions will be
        exp(i * 0) = 1
        1 * 1 = 1.
    This also works in a way that cascades when reducing from the
    general polar form:
        1 * exp(i * 0) = 1 * 1 = 1
    
    Raise ValueError if the expr is not obviously equivalent to a
    complex number polar form.

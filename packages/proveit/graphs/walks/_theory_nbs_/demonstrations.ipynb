    "A __walk__ $W$ in a simple undirected graph $G$ is a sequence $(u = v_0, v_1, ..., v = v_k)$ of vertices of $G$ such that consecutive vertices in the sequence are adjacent in $G$ --- in other words, every pair $\\{v_{i}, v_{i+1}\\}$ of vertices (for $i \\in \\{0, 1, ..., k-1\\}$) in the sequence corresponds to an edge in $G$. We have chosen to embrace a formal definition of a sequence, so a length-$k$ walk in graph $G$ is actually a function, $W:[0, 1, 2, \\ldots, k]\\rightarrow \\texttt{Vertices}(G)$.\n",

The vertices $v_1, v_2, ..., v_{k-1}$ are called _internal vertices_. The number of edges in the walk $W$, denoted by $||W||$, is the _length_ of the walk (in this example, $||W|| = k$).

And despite the annoyance of using $0$-based indexing, such indexing can be useful since we then talk about lengths of walks as the number of edges, which will be one less than the number of vertices in the sequence. Paths of length $k$ can then be defined in terms of injective walks.
